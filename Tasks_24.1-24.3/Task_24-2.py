# Multiprocessing Task â€“ Large-Scale Data Aggregation
# You are working with a large dataset stored in multiple CSV files. Each file contains transaction data from different regions. Your task is to process these files concurrently and aggregate the data into a summary report that includes the total number of transactions and the sum of transaction amounts for each file.
# Use the multiprocessing library to create separate processes for each CSV file.
# Each process should read its assigned file, sum the transaction amounts, and count the number of transactions.
# Aggregate the results from all processes and print the final summary.
