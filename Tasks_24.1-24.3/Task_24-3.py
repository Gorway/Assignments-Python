# Asyncio Task â€“ Asynchronous File Reader and Data Processor
# You are building a system to process JSON files that contain user data (such as user profiles or purchase records). Your task is to read multiple JSON files concurrently and extract specific information like user names or purchase totals.
# Use the asyncio library to create coroutines for reading multiple JSON files concurrently.
# Extract specific information from each file (e.g., user names or purchase totals).
# Print the extracted data after all files have been read and processed.
# Use asyncio.gather() to read all files concurrently.
